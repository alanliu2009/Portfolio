Hello, I'm Alan Liu. I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland, on track to graduate with a B.S. in Spring 2025!
Here, you can see my compiled projects in the portfolio folder above, but the projects themselves can be found in separate folders.
For any further inquries, my email is alanliu2009@gmail.com.
